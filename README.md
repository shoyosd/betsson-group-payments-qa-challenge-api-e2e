## Acknowledgements and Introduction

**Hello, my name is Sebastián Hoyos**, and I am a **QA Automation Engineer** passionate about ensuring software quality through test automation. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to collaborate on this project and showcase my skills. Throughout my career, I have worked with a wide range of tools and frameworks like **Selenium**, **TestNG**, **Cucumber**, **Cypress**, **Playwright**, **RestAssured** and **RestSharp**, which have enabled me to build robust tests for complex applications, both at the user interface and API levels.

### What can I bring to the table?

- **Test Automation**: I can design and develop automated testing frameworks from scratch for both web applications and APIs, following best practices like the **Page Object Model (POM)** and **Clean Code** principles.
  
- **API Testing**: With experience using tools such as **Postman**, I perform comprehensive testing to ensure that API services and endpoints work correctly and are resilient across different scenarios.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: I develop complete tests to verify the system's behavior from the end user's perspective, ensuring that the entire workflow runs smoothly.


### My Approach

I believe that automation is a powerful tool to improve software quality and increase efficiency in testing processes. My approach focuses on creating scalable, optimized, and easy-to-maintain solutions that can be continuously integrated into **CI/CD pipelines**.

### Thank You

Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to participate in this project. I am excited to contribute to the success of the team and the product. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need more information about the work performed.

Best regards,  
**Sebastián Hoyos**
